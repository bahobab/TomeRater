Exercice with Python class:
A user (instance of User class) can read a book and rate a book (instance of Book class. There are two book subclasses: Fiction and Non_Fiction)

1. Clone the repo
2. Open your command line and navigate to the TomeRater directory:
cd TomeRater
3. Run	the	file populate.py, using the command:
python3	-i populate.py

This file, populate.py, will create	a TomeRater object called Tome_Rater
and	fill it with some users and books. The -i flag will	leave the terminal
open for you to play with.

4. You can then run some of your methods you created in the last section by using syntax like: 

>>>Tome_Rater.most_positive_user()

5. To see more methods run
>>>dir(Tome_Rater)

Note to reviewer: All suggested funtionality methods have been implemented
